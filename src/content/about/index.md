Hi! I am Darian Lio. I am an aspiring Software Developer based in Toronto, CA. I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Engineering at Queen's University. I am incredibly passionate in building web apps and design.

Currently, I work in a team as a Software Developer Intern at IBM to develop interesting features on a daily basis.

Outside of work, you would see me stuck playing music on my guitar, going to the gym, or playing video games with friends!
