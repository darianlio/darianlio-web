Hi! I am Darian Lio, an aspiring Software Developer from Toronto, CA. I am currently an undergraduate from Queen's University, majoring in Computer Engineering.

Currently, I work in a team as a Software Developer Intern at IBM to develop interesting features on a daily basis.

When I'm not thinking about work or personal projects, I might be playing my guitar, going to the gym, or stuck at friend's house playing video games.
